In this section I want to talk about functions again. We've been using functions from the beginning, but you’ve learned a lot about R since then, so we can talk about them in more detail. In particular, I want to show you how to create your own. To stick with the same basic framework that I used to describe loops and conditionals, here’s the syntax that you use to create a function:

```
FNAME <- function( ARG1, ARG2, ETC ) {
  STATEMENT1
  STATEMENT2
  ETC
  return( VALUE )
}
```
What this does is create a function with the name `fname`, which has arguments `arg1`, `arg2` and so forth. Whenever the function is called, R executes the statements in the curly braces, and then outputs the contents of value to the user. Note, however, that R does not execute the function commands inside the workspace. Instead, what it does is create a temporary local environment: all the internal statements in the body of the function are executed there, so they remain invisible to the user. Only the final results in the `value` are returned to the workspace.

## A boring example

To give a simple example of this, let’s create a function called `quadruple` which multiplies its inputs by four. 
```{r}
quadruple <- function(x) {
  y <- x * 4
  return(y)
}
```
When we run this command, nothing happens apart from the fact that a new object appears in the workspace corresponding to the `quadruple` function. Not surprisingly, if we ask R to tell us what kind of object it is, it tells us that it is a function:
```{r}
class(quadruple)
```

And now that we’ve created the `quadruple()` function, we can call it just like any other function:
```{r}
quadruple(10)
```
An important thing to recognise here is that the two internal variables that the `quadruple` function makes use of, `x` and `y`, stay internal. At no point do either of these variables get created in the workspace.

## A fun example

First I'll load the packages I'll need

```{r}
library(grid)
library(TurtleGraphics)
```

Now I'll define a function that draws a polygon:

```{r}
turtle_polygon <- function(sides) {
  for(i in 1:sides) {
    turtle_forward(distance = 10)  # move 
    turtle_left(angle = 360/sides) # turn left
  }
}
```

Now we can have our turtle draw whatever polygon we like:

```{r, fig.show='animate', interval=0.2, cache=TRUE}
turtle_init()
turtle_polygon(sides = 9)
```

## Default arguments 

Okay, now that we are starting to get a sense for how functions are constructed, let’s have a look at a slightly more complex example. Consider this function: 

```{r}
pow <- function(x, y = 1) { 
  out <- x ^ y  # raise x to the power y 
  return(out)
}
```

The `pow` function takes two arguments `x` and `y`, and computes the value of $x^y$. For instance, this command
```{r}
pow(x = 4, y = 2)
```

computes 4 squared. The interesting thing about this function isn’t what it does, since R already has has perfectly good mechanisms for calculating powers. Rather, notice that when I defined the function, I specified `y=1` when listing the arguments? That’s the default value for `y`. So if we enter a command without specifying a value for `y`, then the function assumes that we want `y=1`:

```{r}
pow(x = 3)
```

However, since I didn’t specify any default value for `x` when I defined the `pow` function, the user must input a value for `x` or else R will spit out an error message.

## Unspecified arguments 

The other thing I should point out while I’m on this topic is the use of the `...` argument. The `...` argument is a special construct in R which is only used within functions. It is used as a way of matching against multiple user inputs: in other words, `...` is used as a mechanism to allow the user to enter as many inputs as they like. I won’t talk at all about the low-level details of how this works at all, but I will show you a simple example of a function that makes use of it. Consider the following:

```{r}
doubleMax <- function(...) {
  max.val <- max(...)  # find the largest value in ...
  out <- 2 * max.val   # double it
  return(out)
}
```

The `doubleMax` function doesn't do anything with the user input(s) other than pass them directly to the `max` function. You can type in as many inputs as you like: the `doubleMax` function identifies the largest value in the inputs, by passing all the user inputs to the `max` function, and then doubles it. For example:

```{r}
doubleMax(1, 2, 5)
```

## More on functions?

There’s a lot of other details to functions that I’ve hidden in my description in this chapter. Experienced programmers will wonder exactly how the [scoping rules](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/scoping-rules-of-r.html) work in R, or want to know how to use a function to create variables in other environments, or if function objects can be assigned as elements of a list and probably hundreds of other things besides. However, I don’t want to have this discussion get too cluttered with details, so I think it’s best – at least for the purposes of the current book – to stop here.




## Putting it together

Although the three ideas that we've talked about -- [loops](./loops.html), [branches](./branches.html) and now functions -- are fairly simple ideas individually, they become *extremely* powerful once we start putting them together. To give you an illustration of this, let's make our turtle draw a more complicated shape. First, we'll modify the `turtle_polygon` function to be more flexible:

```{r}
turtle_polygon <- function(sides, size = 10, direction = "left") {
  for(i in 1:sides) {
    turtle_forward(distance = size)  # move 
    turtle_turn(angle = 360/sides, direction = direction) # turn
  }
}
```

With this version of the function, we have control over the number of `sides` in the polygon, the `size` of each step, and the `direction` in which the turtle turns when drawing the polygon. Now we can define another function `which_way` that uses an `if` statement to determine the direction that the turtle wants to go depending on the number of sides in the polygon:

```{r}
which_way <- function(sides) {
  if(sides < 6) {
    direction <- "left"
  } else {
    direction <- "right"
  }
  return(direction)
}
```

When we put *these* functions together in a loop, the turtle draws a much more complicated shape:

```{r, fig.show='animate', interval=0.15, cache=TRUE}
turtle_init()
for(s in 3:8) {
  turtle_polygon(sides = s, direction = which_way(s))
}
```

`r emo::ji("turtle")` `r emo::ji("dancing")` `r emo::ji("tada")`

## Exercises

- Write a function that takes a number `x` as input, takes the square root (using `sqrt`), rounds it to the nearest whole number (using `round`) and then returns the result
- Modify your function so that the user can control the number of `digits` to which the result is rounded (recall that `round` has a `digits` argument)
- Modify the function so that by default `digits = 0`

The solutions for these exercises are [here](./scripts/solutions_functions.R).
