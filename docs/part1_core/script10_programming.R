# At this point, you are REMARKABLY close to being able

# going to talk about how to implement the classic 
# Rescorla-Wagner model of Pavlovian conditioning!

  # compute the value of the compound stimulus
  # compute the prediction error
  # compute the change in strength
  # update the association value
  # return the new value
