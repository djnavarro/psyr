# Okay, now we're starting to get into "real" programming. Fortunately, it's
# not as hard as it looks on TV. Step 1? Read this:
#
#    https://psyr.org/loops.html
#
# As you go through it, I *strongly* recommend cutting and pasting the text 
# into a script. You can create a blank script using the menus. 
#
#    File > New File > R Script
#
# Don't write anything in *this* script until you get to the exercises. The
# reason I say this is that there's a "rookie mistake" that I've seen everyone
# fall for, where you start "dumping" everything into one script. It's a bad
# idea because later on you will have NO IDEA WHAT YOUR OLD CODE MEANS. 
#
# In fact, the whole reason I've given you all these "script skeletons" is 
# to encourage you to write the code for each section in a separate file.
# 
# So... when you're doing the mortgage calculator bit, chuck that in a
# *different* script. NOT THIS ONE. Only use this script for your answers
# to the exercise
#
# Okay... so you're ready to do the exercises? Good. Take a good look at
# how I've structured the code below, and notice how I've left some comments
# there. ALWAYS WRITE COMMENTS IN YOUR CODE. YOU WILL THANK YOURSELF LATER



# ---- the first exercises are all about Turtles ----

# load the packages we need
library(TurtleGraphics)

# initialise the terrarium
YOUR-CODE-HERE

# use a for loop to move the turtle in a square
YOUR-CODE-HERE

# now use a for loop to move the turtle in a triangle
YOUR-CODE-HERE




# ---- the last exercise is something different ----

# create the telegrm vector
YOUR-CODE-HERE

# use a while loop to print the words in the telegram
# one by one until it hits the word stop
YOUR-CODE-HERE
