#
# Your tasks!
#
# 1. Read through part 1 "Getting Started". You should get 
#    into the habit of typing the commands shown in the notes.
#    It really does make a difference to "type it yourself" 
#    rather than just read along. The direct link is:

#
# 2. For now, you should just type all your commands at the 
#    console. You don't need to edit the script at all. We'll
#    get to that pretty soon! 
#
# 3. When you get to the end, you'll see some exercises in 
#    section 1.6! See how you do! 
#
# Remember, right now you don't need to edit this script.
