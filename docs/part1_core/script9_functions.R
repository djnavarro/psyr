# Yeah, yeah, you know what to do. Start here:
#
#    https://psyr.org/functions.html
#
# As you go, you'll find that this section has you doing
# interesting things with the turtle. And as usual, I strongly
# recommend that you keep that code in a different script. 
# This time, as you're going through the text, I want you to 
# think about how the "turtle" script should be commented. :-)
#
# To make things interesting, I'm not going to give you any
# structure to work with on the exercises. Here's what you 
# need to do:
#
# 1. Write a function that takes a number x as input, takes 
#    the square root (using sqrt), rounds it to the nearest 
#    whole number (using round) and then returns the result
#
# 2. Modify your function so that the user can control the 
#    number of digits to which the result is rounded (recall 
#    that round has a digits argument)
#
# 3. Modify the function so that by default digits = 0
#
# In the script below, your goal here is to define three
# functions, one for each of these exercises. Try to keep
# your code clean, and commented!
